**Aqueduct AI Gateway** aims to provide a **simple yet fully-featured** AI gateway you can self-host with:

- no [SSO tax](https://konghq.com/pricing)  
- no [observability tax](https://www.litellm.ai/enterprise)  
- no [self-hosting tax](https://portkey.ai/pricing) 
- no [org management tax](https://www.litellm.ai/enterprise)
- etc.

We aim to achieve this by:
- Using a **pass-through approach** that avoids re-implementing the entire OpenAI-compatible APIs or every new feature, and  
- Building on **Django** for a clean, efficient, and maintainable implementation.

If you don‚Äôt need user self-service, take a look at [Envoy AI Gateway](https://aigateway.envoyproxy.io) instead!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

This project aims to use Django for user management/API with minimal additional implementation to create a comprehensive AI gateway. The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Data Model and Administrative Interface:**
    * Implementation of "Teams" and "Organizations" within the data model.
    * Development of an administrative UI using Django for user, team and token management.
    * Focus on authentication and basic management functionalities.

2. **Gateway Relay and Usage Tracking:**
    * Development of a gateway server to relay requests to LLM providers.
    * A `/models` endpoint to list available models.
    * Request routing to specific provider endpoints based on model selection.
    * Request parsing for usage tracking.
    * Database schema optimization for write-heavy usage logging.
    * Request buffering for usage logging.

3. **Advanced Features:**
    * Granular access control based on models and usage limits.
    * A `/metrics` endpoint for monitoring.
    * Dashboard to track usage of orgs, teams and users.
    * Model cooldown and retry logic.
    * Management of MCP tool calling server endpoints e.g. from the [MCP Server list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file).
    * Daily usage quotas/limits for models.
    * Simple chat interface to try models.

4. **(Optional) API Abstraction:**
    * Implementation of a stable API interface (e.g., OpenAI-compatible).
    * Development of backend adapters for different LLM providers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

![AI Gateway Architecture](./docs/assets/AI%20Gateway%20Architecture.excalidraw.svg "AI Gateway Architecture")

The gateway server processes requests, interacts with the Django API for token verification, and updates usage logs. Django frontend provides a UI with role-based access control:

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

| Role           | Functionality                                                     |
| -------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User           | API key generation, team key viewing.                             |
| Team-Admin     | Team API key management, team usage viewing.                      |
| Org-Admin      | Team creation, user management within the organization.           |
| (Super)Admin   | Organization management, global usage limit modification.         |

**Organization and User Management:**

* User assignment to organizations based on SSO group memberships.
* Specific admin group used to assign Admins.
* Org-Admin management by Admin in UI (group).

**Usage Reporting and Metrics:**

* Usage reports based on user roles (team, organization, global).
* `/metrics` endpoint for system monitoring + usage.


## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

1. Implementation user management in Django.
2. Implementation of gateway server with basic features using user management as service.
3. Create docker compose setup.
4. Extension of gateway/management service for more advanced features.

## ‚ùì Open Questions

* Integration of Open Policy Agent (OPA) for authorization and policy enforcement?
